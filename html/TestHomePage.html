                    <p>he watched while at Harvard Law School, and began recruiting professors and experts to record
                        lectures.[1][3] Rollins invested all his money in the company, at one point using up all his
                        credit
                        cards, selling almost all his suits from his Washington days, and living in an attic.[1]
                        Because
                        his
                        company was for-profit, Rollins adapted course offerings to please customers; he threw out one
                        course
                        because the professor constantly insulted the viewers during lectures and he asked some other
                        professors to re-record segments that had unsupported political commentary.[1] By 2000 the
                        company
                        was
                        well established, with about $20M in annual revenue.[1] In October 2006, the company was
                        acquired
                        by
                        Brentwood Associates, a private equity investment firm.[4] In 2011, the firm had 200
                        employees.[1]
                        In
                        2016, the company offered a streaming service, charging $20 per month, and getting access via
                        computer
                        to about 280 courses in their catalog.[3]
